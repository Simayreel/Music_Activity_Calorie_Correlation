# Music_Activity_Calorie_Correlation
## Dataset Description
### Sources: Music listening data from Spotify and physical activity data from Health app.
### Structure: Date, total minutes of music listened, total steps walked, calories burned, distance traveled. 
## Project Idea
### My project investigates the correlation between the amount of music I listened to daily and my physical activity levels, specifically from walking and calories burned. My hypothesis is “The more music I listen to in a day, the more I walk and burn calories.” My aim is to identify a positive correlation and explore how music influences physical activity.
## Project Plan
### 1. Data Collection: I will gather the daily data of music listening time and physical activity. 
### 2. Data Cleaning: I will manage missing or inconsistent entries and ensure both datasets align by date for correct comparison. 
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I will visualize the trends and check for outliers and anomalies in the datasets.
### 4. Correlation Analysis: I will visualize the relationship using scatter plots and regression lines. Hence, compute the correlation coefficients to determine the relationship between my datasets. 
### 5. Hypothesis Testing: I will use statistical tests to to validate my hypothesis. 
### 6. Conclusion: I will summarize my findings and discuss the musics impact on physical activity.
